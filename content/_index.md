## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

I am now an assistant professor in the School of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the SWJTU (the Southwest JiaoTong University). Prior to that, I received my Ph.D. degree from the Advanced Information Technology Laboratory, Department of Information Science and Electrical Engineering, KYUSHU University. My advisor was [Prof. Jianjun Zhao](http://stap.ait.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~zhao/) and I was co-advised by [Prof. Lei Ma](https://malei.xyz/). My research interests mainly focus on software analysis and testing.
